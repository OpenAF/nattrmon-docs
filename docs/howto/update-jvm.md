# Update the JVM version

nAttrMon is based on OpenAF so in order to update the JVM used you need to refer to the [OpenAF JVM update instructions](https://docs.openaf.io/docs/howto/Update-JVM-version.html)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Usually nAttrMon is installed as a sub-folder of the OpenAF runtime installation in use.
